# Smart Contracts

This repository contains a collection of smart contracts written to practice and understand the Solidity programming language and Ethereum smart contract development.

The focus is learning by building. These contracts are intentionally simple and exploratory, designed to reinforce core concepts rather than serve as production-ready implementations.

## Purpose

- Learn Solidity syntax and structure
- Understand how smart contracts behave on the EVM
- Practice common patterns used in Ethereum development
- Experiment freely without worrying about production constraints

Each contract targets a specific idea so the logic stays clear and approachable.

## Contents

- Basic Solidity contracts
- State variables and function visibility
- Mappings, structs, and events
- Simple ownership and access control patterns
- Incremental improvements as concepts evolve

Contracts are kept small and readable to make experimentation easy.

## Tech Stack

- Solidity
- Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
- Remix / Hardhat (depending on the contract)

Any tool-specific details are documented inside the contracts themselves.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the contracts in Remix or a local Solidity environment
3. Read the code and comments
4. Modify and test contracts to deepen understanding

If you’re learning Solidity, feel free to fork and experiment.

## Disclaimer

- Educational use only
- Not audited
- Do not deploy to mainnet
- Security and gas optimization are explored gradually
